# instant-view-opener

An extension for opening webpages in instant view templates!

## Usage

Select a template by opening its main page in the first tab of the window.

The main page has the following format:
```
https://instantview.telegram.org/contest/example.org/templateN/
```

Then, while you're browsing on the website the template is for, you can press `Alt+W` to open the current page in the selected template and `Alt+Q` to open the link you're hovering instead.

While editing a template, press `Alt+R` to hide the _Original_ section from the IV editor, leaving only the code and the preview. To restore it, refresh the page.
